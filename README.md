We will be working on cleaning up our code and making parts of it Open Source,
We do love Open Source, however, 
we still have some code cleanup and legal considerations to work out
before we release any of our code under a permissive licensee.

In the interim please respect our intellectual property.

Note: much of the downloaded and packaged by `./deploy.sh` is Open Source.
We already happily give back to the community on those projects already.
:-D
